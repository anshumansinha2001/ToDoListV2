- **Checkbox Functionality:** Easily mark tasks as complete with a checkbox click.
- **Customized URLs:** Tailor your own to-do list by adding a custom title after the URL.

## Technology Stack

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for efficient and flexible data storage.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js, facilitating robust backend development.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Embedded JavaScript (EJS):** Templating engine for generating dynamic HTML content.
- **JavaScript:** Core programming language for building interactive and dynamic features.
